DESCRIPTION:
This project is a personal portfolio website created as part of my internship to showcase my learning, skills, and web development projects. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide a single, organized place where all my work can be viewed in a clean and professional way. It acts as a digital resume, allowing anyone visiting the website to understand who I am, what I have built, and how I am progressing as a web developer.

The portfolio was designed and developed using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on layout, design, and user experience. The structure of the website is kept simple and easy to navigate so that visitors can quickly find the information they need. The navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to jump between different sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact. This improves usability and gives the site a modern, organized feel.

One of the most important sections of the portfolio is the Projects section, which highlights the main works I have completed during my internship. These include the Movie Rating Website, the Quiz Application, and the E-Learning Platform UI. Each project is displayed in a card-style layout with a title, short description, and action buttons such as “View on GitHub” or “View Live.” This layout makes it easy for viewers to explore each project individually and understand what it does.

The Movie Rating Website project demonstrates my ability to design layouts and display structured content such as movie cards, ratings, and basic interactivity. The Quiz Application shows my understanding of JavaScript by allowing users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive a final score. The E-Learning Platform UI showcases my UI and design skills by presenting course listings, pricing in euros, video previews, and a learning flow in a visually appealing way. Together, these three projects reflect a wide range of front-end skills, from static layout design to interactive logic.

The portfolio itself is styled with a consistent color theme and typography, making it visually attractive and easy to read. Special care was taken to ensure the website is responsive, meaning it works well on different screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This is an essential feature for any modern website and shows my understanding of responsive design principles.

Another important aspect of this portfolio is that it reflects honest learning and growth. Instead of trying to appear overly advanced, the website presents real projects that I have worked on during my internship. This makes the portfolio genuine and trustworthy, which is very important for academic and internship-based evaluations.

From a technical point of view, this project helped me practice how to structure a complete website, link multiple sections together, and organize code properly. It also helped me understand how to create reusable styles and maintain consistency across different pages and components. The portfolio can be easily expanded in the future by adding more projects, improving the design, or including additional sections such as skills, certifications, or contact forms.

Overall, this Personal Portfolio Website serves as a complete representation of my work as an intern and a front-end learner. It brings together multiple projects into a single platform, making it easy for reviewers and visitors to explore my progress, creativity, and technical abilities. This project not only showcases my current skills but also provides a strong foundation for future growth as a web developer.
